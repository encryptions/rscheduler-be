# RScheduler

This is the backend for a free alternative to other Reddit post automation apps, RScheduler.

To self-host, this will need to be connected to the frontend (which you can also find the source for on my GitHub profile), and this also needs to be connected to some kind of SQL database following the table style provided in the User.java class which can be found in the src file of this repository.

This uses Reddit's OAuth system to authenticate users and add their accounts to the user selector and handles post automation/scheduling.
